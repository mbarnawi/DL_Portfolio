This directory includes a project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images. The focus of the project is on classifying fashion items, such as clothing and shoes, using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project serves as an example of building a CNN model for image classification.

# Results 
I made an attempt to classify the provided image. The image and its corresponding prediction probabilities are shown below:<br><img src="https://github.com/mbarnawi/DL_Portfolio/blob/main/image%20classification%20for%20MNIST%20dataset/img/prediction.PNG" width=400>
<br>
## The prediction probabilities for each class are as follows: : 
[9.1005280e-11, 3.8259240e-13, 3.3847740e-13, 4.6454333e-12,
        2.1615637e-12,<br>4.6999129e-09, 7.0419837e-10, 1.6524285e-06,
        4.3722980e-11, 9.9999833e-01]
<br>Based on the probabilities, the highest value corresponds to class 9, which represents "Ankle boot". Therefore, the prediction was correct.
<br>Please refer to the notebook included in the directory for more detailed information.
